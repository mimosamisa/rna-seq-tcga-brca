# rna-seq-tcga-brca

Differential gene expression analysis of TCGA breast cancer RNA-Seq data



Overview

This project performs differential gene expression analysis on RNA-Seq data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify genes differentially expressed between breast cancer tumor and normal samples.
